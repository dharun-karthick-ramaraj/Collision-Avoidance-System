## Overview

A collision avoidance system aims to **detect obstacles**, **assess risk**, and **plan safe actions** to avoid or mitigate collisions. Typical deployments include mobile robots, ADAS/AV stacks, drones, and industrial platforms. The accompanying report explains the problem formulation, design choices, experiments, and conclusions for this specific project.

## Key objectives

* **Detect** potential obstacles or collision risks.
* **Predict/assess** the likelihood and severity of collision (e.g., time‑to‑collision).
* **Plan** a safe maneuver (brake/steer/stop/yield) under constraints.
* **Evaluate** performance via experiments described in the report (accuracy, latency, distance to obstacle, etc.).


## How to use this repo today

1. **Read the report** for the complete description of goals, methods, and results: [`Collision Avoidance System.pdf`](./Collision%20Avoidance%20System.pdf).
2. If you plan to build on this work, open an **Issue** describing intended enhancements (e.g., code release, dataset pointers, benchmarking scripts, or a simulation environment).

## Reproducibility (when code is added)

When/if code is introduced, include the following sections:

* **Environment setup:** Python/ROS/Sim version pins, `requirements.txt`/`environment.yml`.
* **Data acquisition:** links or scripts for datasets/simulators.
* **Training/evaluation:** exact commands to reproduce results from the report.
* **Configuration:** sample configs and expected outputs.

## Results & evaluation

All metrics, plots, and ablation details are documented in the **PDF report**.
